## Figure 1 
![V7_Figure_1](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a9525ec2-0186-43e7-9363-e9039e84bd8b)


In this figure we aim to show:
- The density layer that connects the shelf and the abyss (z>3500 m), which is chosen as the minimum density definition for our DSW [a,b]., i.e., $\sigma_0\ >\ 27.85\ kg \ m^{-3}$ for MOM5, and  $\sigma_2\ >\ 37.18\ kg \ m^{-3}$ for MOM6. The cross-siobath flow on this density level is the one chosen to represent the DSW overflow. These values were chosen as the average density in each model's control simulation at z = 3500 m

- The density range in which we average the SWMT [dashed line on c,d], to obtain our DSW formation timeseries. i.e., $\sigma_0\ =\ [27.85,\ 27.86]$ for MOM5, and $\sigma_2\ =\ [37.18,\ 37.19]$ for MOM6.
- That DSW sucessfully reaches the abyss [e,f]

## Figure 2

In this figure, the intent is to show we have a consistent decrease in DSW formation and overflow, as we thicken the top cell. some additional points to make are:

- SWMT shift towards progressively lighter values as we thicken the top cell
- Possibly waters cease reching the 3500 m level in the 5m simulation in MOM5
