# Draft figure/paper outline

As we are reaching the final results of our simulations, we can start drafting the figures/outline for the manuscrupt.

Aim Journal : [Journal of Advances in Modeling Earth Systems (JAMES)](https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/journal/19422466/journal-metrics)


**NOTE: Each figure should have its own notebook.**

# Paper outline

### Introduction

### Methods
  - ACCESS-OM2-01, and PANAN-01 desciption:
     - Highlight the differences in B.L. mixing scheme (EPBS, KPP), and how previous work highlight that the BLMS can alter MLD in full convection experiments [Van Roekel 2018](https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1029/2018MS001336)
     - Describe the 1mtop and 5mtop experiments
  -  Describe methods used to calculate the Surface Water Mass Transformation, and mass transport crossing the slope
  -  Describe the FWF distribution experiments and/or quasi-2d experiments
    **We might need an experiment table**
### Results Part 1 - DSW in OM2 and Panan
**Figure 1** shows how the SWMT changes between models with different top cell resolutions, and a timeseries of the DSW transport accross the 1km isobath

  - to do: Maintain only 5mtop and 1mtop experiments for OM2 and panan. Also add a second panel with mass transport across slope foe simulations


### Results Part 2 - FWF distribution and or /ocean only (TBD)
  -  FWFdist - Highlight that what is controlling the DSW is the different potential for density gain when the same SI-freshwater flux is added in cells with different sizes
  -  Ocean only experiments will be perfomed to separate the effect of SI-ocean feedbacks

### Remaining decisions
  - Should we include the halfmtop experiment in the paper? that experiment was done only with ACCESS-OM2, but not Panan01. It might be necessary to run a halfmtop case with pana if we want to include it.
  - Do we want to include the single column experiments?
  - Do we want to include N.A. SWMT?
  - As far as I know, there is no paper yet validating DSW formation in PANAN....DO we need to include a session valudating DSW formation in the model first?

### Supplementary material images
Contours of mass transport accross the 1km isobath. We should discuss if this is is better placed in the supmat or main ms in the next DSw meeting
