In this figure we aim to show:
- The density layer that connects the shelf and the abyss (z>3500 m), which is chosen as the minimum density definition for our DSW [a,b]., i.e., $\sigma_0\ >\ 27.85\ kg \ m^{-3}$ for MOM5, and  $\sigma_2\ >\ 37.18\ kg \ m^{-3}$ for MOM6

- The density range in which we average the SWMT [dashed line on c,d], to obtain our DSW formation timeseries. i.e., $\sigma_0\ =\ [27.85,\ 27.86]$ for MOM5, and $\sigma_2\ =\ [37.18,\ 37.19]$ for MOM6.
- That DSW sucessfully reaches the abyss [e,f]

### Introduction

### Methods
  - ACCESS-OM2-01, and PANAN-01 desciption:
     - Highlight the differences in B.L. mixing scheme (EPBS, KPP), and how previous work highlight that the BLMS can alter MLD in full convection experiments [Van Roekel 2018](https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1029/2018MS001336)
     - Describe the 1mtop and 5mtop experiments
  -  Describe methods used to calculate the Surface Water Mass Transformation, and mass transport crossing the slope
  -  Describe the FWF distribution experiments and/or quasi-2d experiments
    **We might need an experiment table**
