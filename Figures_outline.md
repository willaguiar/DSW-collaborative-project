# Draft figure/paper outline

As we are reaching the final results of our simulations, we can start drafting the figures/outline for the manuscrupt.

Aim Journal : [Journal of Advances in Modeling Earth Systems (JAMES)](https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/journal/19422466/journal-metrics)


**NOTE: Each figure should have its own notebook.**

# Paper outline

### Introduction

### Methods
  - ACCESS-OM2-01, and PANAN-01 desciption:
     - Highlight the differences in B.L. mixing scheme (EPBS, KPP), and how previous work highlight that the BLMS can alter MLD in full convection experiments [Van Roekel 2018](https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1029/2018MS001336)
  -  Describe methods used to calcualte the Surface Water Mass Transformation, and mass transport crossing the slope
  -  Describe the FWF distribution experiments and/or quasi-2d experiments
    
### Results Part 1 - MOM5/MOM6 experiments
