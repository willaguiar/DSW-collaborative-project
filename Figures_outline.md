# Draft figure/paper outline

As we are reaching the final results of our simulations, we can start drafting the figures/outline for the manuscrupt.

Aim Journal : [Journal of Advances in Modeling Earth Systems (JAMES)](https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/journal/19422466/journal-metrics)


**NOTE: Each figure should have its own notebook.**

# Paper outline

### Introduction

### Methods
  - ACCESS-OM2-01, and PANAN-01 desciption:
     - Highlight the differences in B.L. mixing scheme (EPBS, KPP), and how previous work highlight that the BLMS can alter MLD in full convection experiments [Van Roekel 2018](https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1029/2018MS001336)
     - Describe the 1mtop and 5mtop eperiments
  -  Describe methods used to calcualte the Surface Water Mass Transformation, and mass transport crossing the slope
  -  Describe the FWF distribution experiments and/or quasi-2d experiments
    
### Results Part 1 - DSW in OM2 and Panan
**Figure 1** shows how the SWMT changes between models with different top cell resolutions, and a timeseries of the DSW transport accross the 1km isobath

-to do: reorganize the panels so they are symetric



### Remaining decisions
  - Should we include the halfmtop experiment in the paper? that experiment was done only with ACCESS-OM2, but not Panan01. It might be necessary to run a halfmtop case with pana if we want to include it.


### Supplementary material images
Contours of mass transport accross the 1km isobath. We should discuss if this is is better placed in the supmat or main ms in the next DSw meeting
