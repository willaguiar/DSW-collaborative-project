# Draft figure/paper outline

As we are reaching the final results of our simulations, we can start drafting the figures/outline for the manuscrupt.

Aim Journal : [Journal of Advances in Modeling Earth Systems (JAMES)](https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/journal/19422466/journal-metrics)


**NOTE: Each figure should have its own notebook.**

# Paper outline

### Introduction

### Methods
  - ACCESS-OM2-01, and PANAN-01 desciption:
     - Highlight the differences in B.L. mixing scheme (EPBS, KPP), and how previous work highlight that the BLMS can alter MLD in full convection experiments [Van Roekel 2018](https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1029/2018MS001336)
  -  Describe methods used to calcualte the Surface Water Mass Transformation, and mass transport crossing the slope
  -  Describe the FWF distribution experiments and/or quasi-2d experiments
    
### Results Part 1 - DSW in OM2 and Panan
Figure 1 shows how the SWMT changes between models with different top cell resolutions, and a timeseries of the DSW transport accross the 1km isobath

### Images that might be useful to have as a supplementary material
Contours of mass transport accross the 1km isobath. We should discuss if this is is better placed in the supmat or main ms in the next DSw meeting
