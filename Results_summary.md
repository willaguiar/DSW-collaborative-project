# Hypotheses

There are 2 main possible reasons why ACCESS-OM2-01 is able to form DSW along the shelf

    I-  Accurate katabatic wind depiction in JRA55: High resolution JRA55 winds can allow coastal polynyas to form,  permitting brine rejection and heat loss to produce DSW. We can address that by running experiments with CORE and ERA5 wind forcing, and checking to which extent DSW is formed in these runs. 
    II- Fine ocean grid resolution: The fine (horizontal and verical) resolution of the ocean grid could allow the topography to have the optimal slope/configuration for DSW overflows. We can test that by changing the vertical resolution of the ocean grid.
