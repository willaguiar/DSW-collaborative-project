# Hypothesis

There are 2 main possible reasons why ACCESS-OM2-01 is able to form DSW along the shelf

    I-  Accurate katabatic wind depiction in JRA55 high resolution reanalysis product: This allows coastal polynyas to form and brine rejection and heat loss to produce DSW. We can address that by running experiments with CORE and ERA5 wind forcing, and checking to which extent DSW is formed in these runs.
    II- Fine grid resolution: Fine horizonal and vertical resolution could allow
