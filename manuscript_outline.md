## Paper outline

- **Introduction**:

    Literature review of constraints on DSW formation around Antarctica ( Horizonal resolution, Vertical resolution, slope representation...). Importance of accurate surface fluxes for DSW formation. Ocean model sensitivity to surface fluxes (e.g., Van Roekel et al 2018)

- **Methods**:
  
    Part 1, ocean and sea ice model: ACCESS-OM2-01 description. Highlight OM2 skill in forming DSW at the Antarctic shelf. Description of Pan-antarctic/MOM6. Either show DSW formation in MOM6 or cite Christina's paper ( in dev...). Describe analysis methods (SWMT, flow over 1km isobath as overflow diagnostic). Highlight differences in OSBL mixing scheme between OM2 (KPP) and MOM6 (EPBL) and why they matter for the study.  Describe vertical grid adjustment (refer to fig1 of results, which should have a plot of the different z-grids). Define the density limits used for DSW (perhaps add a figure on Supp. showing they match densities below 2000m in the Southern ocean)


    Part 2,  Single column experiments: Describe ocean-only configuration of single-column experiments, and freshwater fluxes used to force the model. Describe latent heat flux adjustments used to bring net heat fluxes in the ocean model back to the values found in the Weddell Sea.


- **Results 1, OM2 and Panan**:

    Describe changes in SWMT in OM2 and Panan top cell experiments. We will have 1 figure with 4 panels, showing 1-Grid differences, 2- SWMT $f(\sigma_0)$ , 3- DSW cross-slope transport  $f(\sigma_0)$, 4- DSW Cross-slope trnasport timeseries. Figure scketch below:

## For discussion
- Do we want to add an Analysis od NADW formation and sensitivity to top cell thickness?
- Do we want to show the DSW sensitivity to salinity restoring? (perhaps only in the Supplementary material)
