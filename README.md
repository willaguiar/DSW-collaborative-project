# DSW-collaborative-project

This is a collaborative project to investigate why ACCESS-OM2-01 creates Dense Shelf Water (DSW) accurately along the Antarctic Shelf. This is a central repository where we can work on analysis scripts together, suggest new analysis directions, discuss figures etc. The results found here, can help further develop ACCESS-CM2 to form DSW too.

# How it works

All aspects of the project are tracked through issues. Create an issue to represent each small task. Issues will develop to include discussion of analysis methods and figures associated with each task.

The [Project/analysis Overview](https://github.com/users/willaguiar/projects/3) lists all the analysis tasks (as detailed in the issues) at various stages.

To start contributing to the code, make your own branch directly in this repository, edit away on your branch, and then submit pull requests between your branch and the master branch (or merge directly).

As we figure out the main results and develop the storyline, we can add to the Results Summary here and draft figure list for the paper here.
